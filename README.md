## Bonjour/Hi 👋

My name is Louis, Louis Fillon. I’m passionate about data science and art, with a background as a financial auditor, entrepreneur, and business analyst.

In this repository, you’ll find projects that showcase my skills, along with a few little goodies—because I treat it like a Pokédex of my epicurean life.

***Disclaimer***: There won’t be any personal music prereleases in the Music folder.

<!--(add track excerpts titled "preview track.wav" and a mockup of the cover/calligram)-->

Looking forward to chatting about anything!
