A good start might be to download the list of positions currently used by your payroll system, and the list of the different earnings codes since we will be able to reflect this information in the export to payroll settings.The nomenclature of the various positions will be very important so that they are easily recognized and well understood by all employees and managers. Be careful, keep it as short as possible, because that is what will appear on employee schedules.Employees must understand where and when they will be scheduled, but also in which specific position (role and tasks).The positions will also be linked to specific earnings codes, which will allow optimal export to your payroll management system.Setting up is therefore extremely important and the more carefully it is done, the more time you will save in the future.Adding a department and/or sub-department is available if and only if you already have one in the structure you currently have.Administrators have the possibility of asking us, through a ticket, to activate the option of being able to add new positions.The ticket must contain:Your current structure (click on Structure & Positions, then Export the structure in Excel)Modify the document, and highlight these changes (indicate a color for each type of change: move, delete, create, new appointment)Submit a ticket, with the file attachedWarning :Once you associate a schedule with a position for an employee, we can no longer delete it.Helpful?00Updated: 3 years ago Share :"}
