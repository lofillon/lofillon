{"title": "1/08/20: Extension of COVID-19 premiums to RPA staff and additional eligible expenses", "url": "https://emprez.zohodesk.com/portal/en/kb/articles/extension-of-covid-19-premiums-to-rpa-staff-and-additional-eligible-expenses", "content": "As of June 8th 2020, the PAB hourly rate after the increase of $4/hour was not to exceed $21,27/hour.It some of your PAB employees have been remunerated since June 8 at an hourly rate greater than $21,27, you will have to make sure to recover the overpayments from these employees.Example: Hourly rate before Covid-19: $18Hourly rate + $4 = $22/hour ; this hourly rate therefore exceeds the prescribed $21,27. There is an overpayment of $0,73.To be fair, the increase to be applied to the employee's hourly rate should have been $3,27/hour instead of $4/hour.To simplify the calculation of this premium we suggest that you create an hourly premiun in $ which corresponds to the difference between the employee's basic hourly rate and the maximum $ 21.27.Example: Your PAB has a base salary of $ 18, you apply an hourly premium of $ 3.27 ($ 21.23 - $ 18 = $ 3.27)If all or a large part of your PABs have the same basic hourly rate, you can use the Add hourly premiums and positions in batch optionFor PAB that do not have the same basic hourly rate as the others, you can create a dedicated hourly premium in $.If all of your PAB are not at the same base hourly rate with each other, you will need to create as many hourly premium in dollars as different wages.WARNING:Please note that this option REPLACES premiums already assigned to employees. If you want the employee to keep the existing bonuses, you will need to reselect them when modifying/adding to the existing position.Helpful?00Updated: 4 years ago Share :"}
