This is usually three digits, eg.: 003 or 316.Confirm the pay week to export (Week 1 or Week 2).Check the configuration of the shortcut to the Sage \"Punches\" directoryMake sure the shortcut to the Sage punch directory is listed:    \\\\J0xxxFPC10\\sageges$\\punktel The xxx in the shortcut must be replaced by the number of your branchThis must be done by you, because it must be connected to the PJC network to access this directory.CentreRx removes access to the PJC network when it allows an external user to connect to the network computer, which prevents us, Emprez, from completing this verification with you.Make sure the export file is named correctlyThe export file should always be named POIN01.DBFCheck for duplicates, delete if there are anyDelete the additional digits after POIN01 eg.: POIN01(8).DBF, POIN01(7).DBF, POIN01(6).DBFThe file will not be read if the file has the wrong name.Helpful?00Updated: 2 years ago Share :"}
