This Emprez feature eliminates the need to manually adjust each employee's timesheet every few minutes.In the questionnaire, we ask you for the automatic adjustments you want for arrivals (before and after). These automatic adjustments will then apply by default for all employees in your company. You can then, on a case-by-case basis, if you wish, modify these parameters individually.To understand the principle of automatic adjustments, please refer to the scenarios below:Automatic adjustment for arrival beforeThe period preceding the start of a shift and during which the punching employee will have his punching hour automatically adjusted to the shift scheduled.Example:Automatic adjustment of 15 minutes for arrival before the scheduled time. Planned schedule starting at 9:00 am If the employee punches between 8:45 am and 9:00 am, his punch will be automatically adjusted at 9:00 am. He will, therefore, be paid from 9 am, not from his actual punch time.Automatic adjustment for arrival afterPeriod of a few minutes immediately following the start of a shift and during which the punching employee will have his punching hours automatically adjusted to the shift scheduled.Example: Automatic adjustment of 5 minutes for arrival after the scheduled time.Planned schedule starting at 9:00 am.If the employee punches between 9:00 and 9:05 am, his punch will be automatically adjusted at 9:00 am. He will, therefore, be paid from 9:00 am, not from his actual punch time.Automatic adjustment for a departure beforeThe period preceding the end of a shift during which, if the employee punches, his punch time will be automatically adjusted to the shift scheduled.Example:03 min Automatic adjustmentShift scheduled at 5 pm.If the employee punches between 16h57 and 17h00, his punch will be automatically adjusted at 17:00. He will, therefore, be paid until 17:00, not on the basis of this actual punch time.Automatic adjustment for a departure afterThe period after the end of a shift during which, if the employee punches, his punch time will be automatically adjusted to the shift scheduled.Example:10 min automatic adjustmentShift scheduled at 17:00If the employee punches between 17:00 and 17:10, his punch will be automatically adjusted at 17:00. He will, therefore, be paid until 17:00, not on the basis if his actual punch time.To learn more about how to set up the adjustments see the article: Timesheet settingsHelpful?00Updated: 3 years ago Share :"}
