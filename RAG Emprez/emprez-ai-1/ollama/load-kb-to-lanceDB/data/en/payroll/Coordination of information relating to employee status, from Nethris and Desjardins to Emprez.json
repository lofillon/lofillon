Emprez coordinates the information in your payroll system (only if it is Desjardins or Nethris) with your Emprez interface. Thus, the hiring statuses of your employees will be updated automatically in your employees' files.The fields read by Emprez in your web service are: \"Date of rehiring\", \"Date of departure\", \"Vacations banks\"The \"Availability\" field of the web service is not read in Emprez.Concretely, here are the functions and equivalences that will be done:\"Date hired\" from your payroll system will create \"Hiring, detail: API\" in Emprez\"Re-hire date\" from your payroll system will create \"Hire, detail: API\" in Emprez\"Departure date\" coming from your payroll system will create \"Departure, detail: K - Others + the API note + the name of the user who updated the information from Service Web\" in Emprez\"Vacation banks\"Note: If the information on the date already exists in Emprez, for example, I added manually in Emprez that on September 30, my employee = departure, the API will not import dataExample:If I have a departure / re-hiring date in Desjardins, I already have an update in Emprez, and it has put a departure / re-hiring event in Emprez.Even if you remove the departure date in Desjardins, that you update the file information in Emprez, this will not erase the Hire / Departure information that was previously synchronized in Emprez.If this is the case, you will have to manually delete the event in Emprez in the employee's file.If you do not want the departure date and the re-hire date to be synchronized with the Desjardins & Nethris API via Emprez, please follow the steps below:In the Pay menu > Retrieve information from payroll information to update employees file > Choose the employees to update,In front of the name of the employee(s) concerned, check the cases to synchronize or uncheck them to cancel the synchronization with your web service: \"Import departure date\", \"Import rehiring date\", \"Update vacation banks\".Helpful?00Updated: 3 years ago Share :"}
