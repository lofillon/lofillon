She hasn't worked for the week, so you can't find her in the drop-down list in the timesheets menu. You will add a timesheet to him by hand from his employment file.\n\n\n\n\nIn the Employee menu, search the employee,\nClick on Timesheets (at the bottom),\nThen click on Add (at the bottom),\nComplete the boxes in red,\nAdd the appropriate type of timesheet,\nNote the Shift start and end,\nClick on Save, then approve the timesheet.\n\n\n\n\nHelpful?00Updated: 3 years ago Share :"}
