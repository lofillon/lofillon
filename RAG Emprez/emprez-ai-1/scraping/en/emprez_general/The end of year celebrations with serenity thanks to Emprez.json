Thanks to the \n    Batch Add stat. Holidays tool, don't waste time doing it on a case-by-case basis.\n   \n\n    To find out more, see the article: \n    Adding one or more stat. holidays in batch.\n   \n\n\n\n\n    Do your teams or part of your teams work during the public holidays of December 25th, 2024, and/or January 1st, 2025?\n   \n\n    You can reward them with the \n    cumulative stat. holiday premium!\n   \n\n    For more information, see the article: \n    Cumulative premium - Stat. holidays\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎄We wish you a Merry Christmas and a very Happy New Year ☃️\n\nHelpful?10Updated: 26 days ago Share :"}
