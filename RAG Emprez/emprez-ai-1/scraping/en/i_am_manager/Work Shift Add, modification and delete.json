{"title": "Work Shift: Add, modification and delete", "url": "https://emprez.zohodesk.com/portal/en/kb/articles/work-shift-add-modification-and-delete", "content": "\n\n\n\n    The \n    work shift is the basic unit of any schedule that you enter in Emprez.\n    \n\n\n\nCreate a shift\n\n\n\n When you are in one of the options for creating schedules (Schedules by position, Schedules & plans, Schedule by employee) you can create shift manually by selecting the day of your choice opposite the name of the employee concerned. A simple click on the box will open a Work shifts window followed by the name of the employee concerned.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n Only the green fields are necessary to save a quarter of the schedule. The other fields, although optional, allow a greater level of detail to your schedule, making it easier to communicate with your team.\n \n\n\nExplanation of terms\n\n\n1. Shift Start - End\n\n\n\nEnter the hours of work for your shift. (These will be either in 24h format or in AM-PM format, for more details click here.)\nThe hours proposed by default can be modified from your account Preferences, by clicking on your name.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor night shifts that are on two days: it is necessary to put the shift in the day when the shift begins and not where it ends for a good edition of the timesheets.\n    This is very important for proper editing of timesheets; but also for the clarity and understanding of your employee's schedules in their mobile application.\n   \n\nExample: For a shift that begins on Monday at 10 p.m. and ends on Tuesday at 4 a.m., the shift must be placed on the Monday box.\n   \n\n\n\n2. Type of shift\n\n\n\nThe type of shift determines the information that will be displayed in your schedule.\nThe type of shift can also play an important role in your export to payroll.\nThe default shift is Work and represents the hours of work planned for your employee.The other types that can be selected when creating a new shift are: Stat. holiday, Time off (unpaid), Shadowing, Training, Time off (Paid).For example: if the type of shift is a stat. holiday is added to an employee's schedule, the employee will see the holiday displayed in his schedule and not in working hours.\n\n\n3. The shift is published\n\n\nBy checking this option, this shift will become visible to your employee as soon as your schedule is saved. Leave this section blank if you wish to continue making changes to your schedules.\n\n\n4. Note\n\n\n\nThis section is reserved for the exclusive use of Managers and Administrators. \nAny information entered in this section cannot be viewed by the employee. \nThe comments entered in the note will be available in the timesheet associated with this shift.\n\n\n5. Background Color\n\n\n\nYou can assign different types of colors to your shift to make your schedule more visual.\n\n\n6. Meal\n\n\n\n\nEmprez allows you to plan two meal periods for your employees. \nMeals can be scheduled at any time of the day.\nThe time you enter for the meal is for information only and allows Emprez to indicate the time that should be reserved for your employee's meal.\n\nAn employee will not be penalized if his meal is marked at a different time than the time you set in his shift (ex. : 1:00 pm rather than 12:30 pm)\nAll the time between entering the start of the meal and the end of your employee's meal will be deducted from his salary.\n\nCheck paid if you want to cover your employee's mealtime. Note that any excess of the time reserved for the paid meal will be removed from the employee's salary.\nRefer to the article on Timesheet settings for more details on modifying the interaction of Emprez with this field.\n\nExample: You are planning a paid 30-minute meal for your employee. However, it takes 40 minutes. 10 minutes will then be withdrawn from his salary.\n\n\n\n7. Break\n\n\n\n\nBreaks can be scheduled at any time during the shift.\nEnter the time of the shift when the employee will have the right to take a break.\nThe default time reserved for breaks can be set in the settings section of your employee's timesheets.Refer to the article on Timesheet settings to get more details on modifying the interaction of Emprez with this field.\n\n\n\n8.
