Holidays", "url": "https://emprez.zohodesk.com/portal/en/kb/articles/cumulative-premium-stat-holidays", "content": "This premium applies when an employee is scheduled on a stat. holiday. Using this type of premium if you put a holiday on the employee's schedule on a day when he already has a shift, the service will calculate the employee's time according to the premium granted.Example: If an employee works on a stat. holiday, he must be paid on time and a half. If for a typical day the employee earns $18/h and works 8h, he will receive $144. If this worker works on a paid holiday on time and a half with this premium he will be paid $216.Other types of premiums are available on Emprez, for more information we invite you to discover the article: Overview of the different types of premiums.Create, modify or delete a Stat. holidays cumulative premiumClick on Pay, then on Manage Premiums : To display the premiums that you have already created, click on  (to the left of the type of premium concerned) the menu will open.If you don't have one, click on  to create a premium.If you want modify an existing premium, click on .If you want to delete an existing premium, click on . ⚠️Once deleted, the premium can no longer be recovered.Set up a stat. holiday premiumOn the right, select the companies you want to make this premium available to.Name: Name of the premiumPay code: This code is the payroll code in your payroll system. It is with this code that the premium hours will be exported to payroll.Premium Percent or Premium Amount: In $: If you put a value in the dollar value ($), it will add that number of dollars to the employee's hourly rate and pay the employee at the new rate.If you enter $ 2, Emprez will add a fixed amount of $ 2 / hr to the employees who will have this premium on their file.For an employee who is paid $ 15 / hr, with a premium of $ 2, the employee will be paid $ 15 + $ 2 = $ 17 / hr extra.In %: If you mark value in percentage (%), it will calculate that percentage of the employee's hourly wage, then add it to the employee's hourly rate. If you enter 50%, Emprez will calculate 50% from the hourly rate of employees who will have this premium on their record, then add it to the employee's salary.For an employee who is paid $ 15 / hr, with a 50% premium, the employee will be paid $ 15 + ($ 15 x 50%) = $ 22.50 / hr additional.Warning : Do not put a percentage in Emprez with an additional cumulative premium if you use a web service (you do not transfer the information from the Emprez file, you transcribe the information manually line by line in Nethris / Desjardins.)
