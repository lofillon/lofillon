The daily premium and the weekly premium will be triggered and the employee will be paid in duplicate for that same overtime hour.To overcome this duplication, 2 solutions are available to you:1 - Creation of a new department containing positions expressly used to manage daily overtimeThese positions must be added to employee files in order to isolate daily overtime from weekly time,Creation of 3 cumulative premiums:Verification premium Daily overtime: Added to all employees to notify if an employee is paid more than 7.5 hours in a day.Overtime premium: Which will be configured to take positions in the Daily Overtime department only. It must be associated with all employees.Weekly overtime premium: Which will be re-configured only to take charge of all the workstations in the residence EXCEPT those of the Daily overtime department.2 - Adding a timesheet manually for overtime3 - Different earning code in your payroll departmentHelpful?10Updated: 3 years ago Share :"}
