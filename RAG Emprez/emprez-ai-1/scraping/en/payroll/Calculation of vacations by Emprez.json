The amount of hours associated with the vacation represents the estimated time that the employee would have to work in order to obtain the amount of this vacation day according to the salary on file. The service evenly distributes the monetary amount that your employee must be paid for each of the vacation days recorded in his file. Because of this, there may be a few seconds or minutes remaining that will not be routed through the schedules, as our service rounds to the nearest minute.To understand the calculation of the number of hours for each day of vacation, here are the details of the calculations:Please refer to Labor Standards to find out how many days you must five your employees for this vacation. For more information, click here.If you want to allocate a certain number of hours to an employee for each of his vacation days, calculate as in the following example.Example:For $ 400 of the accumulated amount, the employee is paid $ 12.50 an hour. You want each vacation day to be about 8 hours, and no more.$ 400 ÷ $ 12.50 / h = 32 h of vacation granted for the period32 h ÷ 8 h / day = 4 daysYou must, therefore, grant the employee 4 days of vacation for the period so that Emprez pays him 8 hours at a regular rate for each day of vacation.In other words, the number of minutes remaining in the vacancy bank has no bearing on the file as such; it is only there to give an idea of ​​measuring the employee's time. So, if an employee file still shows a few seconds remaining in the bank, but his indemnity section is empty, the employee will, therefore, have received all of the remunerations due to him.It is also important to mention that if manual changes are made to the timesheets (e.g. you decide to pay 40 hours of vacation instead of the 38.5 hours calculated by the service), this will have a direct effect on the calculation of allowances for subsequent vacation days added to the employee's schedule.Helpful?00Updated: 4 years ago Share :"}
