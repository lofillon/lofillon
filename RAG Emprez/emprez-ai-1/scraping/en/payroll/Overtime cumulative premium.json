This is usually a percentage.Example: Each additional hour after 8 hours of daily work will be added an additional cumulative premium of 3$. If the worker works 2 hours more he will have an additional 6$ in premiums to the hourly rate at which he is normally paid.💡This premium can be set by default.Other types of premiums are available on Emprez, for more information we invite you to discover the article: Overview of the different types of premiums.Create, modify or delete an overtime cumulative premiumClick on Pay, then on Manage Premiums : To display the premiums that you have already created, click on  (to the left of the type of premium concerned) the menu will open.If you don't have one, click on  to create a premium.If you want modify an existing premium, click on .If you want to delete an existing premium, click on . ⚠️Once deleted, the premium can no longer be recovered.Set up an overtime cumulative premiumOn the right, select the companies you want to make this premium available to.Name: Name of the premiumPay code: This code is the payroll code in your payroll system. It is with this code that the premium hours will be exported to payroll.Premium Percent or Premium Amount: The additional premium can be in % or $, but often in %.In $: If you put a value in the dollar value ($), it will add that number of dollars to the employee's hourly rate and pay the employee at the new rate.Example:If you enter $ 2, Emprez will add a fixed amount of $ 2 / hr to employees who will have this premium on their file.For an employee who is paid $ 15 / hr, with a premium of $ 2, the employee will be paid $ 15 + $ 2 = $ 17 / hr extra.In %: If you enter a percentage value (%), this will add the amount equivalent to the percentage of the employee's base hourly rate to do the calculation.Example:If you register 50%, has a base hourly rate of $ 18. Imagine that the employee works an additional hour at 50%. Emprez will perform the following calculation: $ 18 + $ 9 x (number of overtime hours worked, here 1) = $ 27Warning : Do not put a percentage in Emprez with an additional cumulative premium if you use a web service (you do not transfer the information from the Emprez file, you transcribe the information manually line by line in Nethris / Desjardins.) In fact, once sent in Nethris / Desjardins, the hourly rate displayed MUST be the employee's regular rate who is going to be put on half-time, because the configuration of this gain in Nethris / Desjardins ensures that: G043 = Number of 'hours x Hourly rate received in the file x 1.5Example:If I put 50% in Emprez, in the cumulative premium configuration, Emprez will automatically calculate the 1.5 BEFORE sending it to Nethris / Dejardins THEN once in Nethris / Desjardin, the above-mentioned calculation will be done: (G043 = number of hours x hourly rate received in file x 1.5) ==> The employee is paid twice.Default premium box: The default premium allows the system to assign the premium to the employee's file without you having to select it each time. However, in order for the premium to be applied by default, you must complete the creation of your premium by saving the changes.⚠️ Please note that the employee files created before the creation of your new default premium will not be updated automatically, you will have to do it yourself manually, one by one or in batch. Type: OvertimePeriod: The period lets the application know when to start counting add the monetary package to the employee.Daily: daily checkWeekly: weekly checkPer fortnight: verification every 2 weeksIf you award multiple cumulative premiums to your employees simultaneously, be careful not to pay them twice. When the sum of the hour's HH:mm : As soon as the employee's hours exceed the number of hours indicated, the lump sum is added to his pay for the period.Below, are different scenarios with detailed calculations:More than HH : mm Example of a typical overtime premium:My overtime premium of 50%, for a weekly check, when the total number of hours is greater than 40 hours and only applies for the hours worked. My employee is paid $15 / hour.→ The premium will add 50% more to my employee's hourly wages for all hours that exceed 40 hours.So, if my employee works 43 hours for a week, 40 hours will be paid at $15 and 3h will be paid at $22.5 ($15 + [$15x50%] = $22.50).Example of daily overtime premium for shifts above 8h:My overtime premium of 50%, for a daily check, when the total hours are greater than 8h and only apply for hours worked. My employee is paid $15/hour.→ The premium will add 50% more to my employee's hourly wages for all hours that exceed 8h per day.So, if my employee works 9.5 hours a day, 8h will be paid at $15 and 1:30 will be paid at $22.50 ($15 + [$15x50%] = $22.50). Smaller than HH : mm When the employee's hours are less than the number of hours entered in the field, the premium pays these hours to the employee at the rate entered in the premium section. If the employee's hours exceed the number of hours entered, these will be paid at the regular rate, plus his position premium if applicable.Example 1:  My overtime premium of $2, for a daily check, when the total hours and apply only for hours worked. My employee is paid $15 / hour. → The premium will only apply when the employee works for a day within 8h.So if for a day he works 7h, he will be paid $17 ($15 + $2 premium) for his day, since the total number of hours worked for the day is less than 8h.If the next day, he does a 10h shift in total, he will be paid $15, since these hours of the day have exceeded 8h.Example 2: My overtime premium of $2, for a weekly check, when the total hours are less than 40h and apply only for the hours worked. My employee is paid $15 / hour.→ The premium will apply to all the hours worked by my employee, if and only if they are below 40 hours. If he works more than 40 hours, the premium will not count.So, for my pay week over 2 weeks, my employee works for more than 42 hours in week 1 and 27h of work in week 2.Week 1: 42 hours of work in totalWeek 2: 27 hours of work in total (less than 40 hours = meets the conditions of the premium)What will be paid to the employee:42h at $15 and 27 at $17 ($15 +$2 premium) for a total of 69h.Maximum HH : mmThe number of hours entered will be paid at the rate indicated in the premium section. The number of excess hours will be paid at the regular rate, plus the position premium if applicable.Example:My overtime premium of $2, for a weekly check, when the total hours of the maximum of 12h and apply only for the hours worked.My employee is paid $15/hour.→ The premium will only apply to the employee's first dozen hours (12 hours) worked. The remaining hours of the week will be paid at the regular rate.Here is how my employee's hours work:Day 1: 8h of work in totalDay 2: 6h of work in totalDay 3: day offDay 4: 8h of work in totalDay 5: 8h of work in totalDay 6: day offDay 7: 4h of work in totalWhat will be paid to the employee:  12h to $17 ($15 + $2 of premium) and 10h to $15 for a total of 34 hours of work.Type of timesheets to be used for calculationsEach box you check means this type of timesheet is included in the Total Hours calculation.Whether or not to include certain types of timesheets is up to you.Applies on a stat. holidayThis box must remain checked so that when the employee has another timesheet in addition to the stat. holiday on the same day, Emprez does the correct calculation.If you uncheck it, all timesheets that are on the same date as a stat. holiday will not be taken into account in the calculation of the Total hours entered above.If you do not want to include the number of hours calculated (automatically) for the employee's public holiday, you can uncheck the Stat. holiday in the list.Example 1: The boxes Stat. holiday does not check and Applies on a stat. holiday is checked.My overtime premium of 50%, for a weekly check, when the total hours are greater than 40h and apply only for hours worked.
