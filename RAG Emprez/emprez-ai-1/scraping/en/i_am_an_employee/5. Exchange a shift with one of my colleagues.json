This will be sent to your colleague and will be copied into their schedule once accepted. Once the shift is confirmed, the following page asks you to provide additional information on the replacement:The reason why cannot work for this shift.The name of the manager to whom you want to submit the request to modify this shift, then click Confirm, then click Submit,And finally, the colleague(s) to whom you want to give the shift, then click on Submit.Once submitted, the shift modification request will be sent, first, to the replacement employee, then when the latter accepts it, a request will appear in the manager's mailbox chosen previously. 3. Request accepted by the employee and by the managerThe replacement employee will receive a notification on their mobile application on the home page, in Messaging > Replacement request. When he accepts the manager will receive a notification that the employee is available to take the shift.The manager approves the shift change, the employee who requested, and the one who accepted receive a notification that the shift change is accepted. This is available in Messaging > Messages.The accepted shift will be deleted from the applicant's schedule and will be added to the replacement's schedule. In the example below, the schedule will be deleted from Ingrid's schedule and added to Sue's schedule.4. Request accepted by the employee, BUT refused by the manager The employee who was chosen from the previous list cannot \"refuse\" a request for a shift exchange as such.If the requester does not receive a reply in their mailbox, this means that:Her colleague is not available to take her shiftOR The manager refused the replacement request. A message is then sent to the employee who has accepted the replacement request telling them that the request has been refused.During this time, the claimant will continue to have their shift still available.In either of the above cases, the claimant must: Report to your shift OR notify your manager that you cannot report for your shift. He must, therefore, notify his employer directly so that the employer can send a request to free employees for a missing shift.Helpful?00Updated: 9 months ago Share :"}
